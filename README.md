Here is a simple Reservoir model, oil+water, inspired by [John Foster](https://johnfoster.pge.utexas.edu/PGE323M-ResEngineeringIII/course-mat/) 

Future abstract:
I propose a Deep RL model which allows to configure multiple wells properties to optimize total oil rate. The envinroment is 2d reservoir with oil and water. In fact a smll piece of hudge reservoir. We propose two networks for the following problems:
<ol>
  <li> Controll wells and set properties by local properties - pressures and saturation in grid blocks with wells
  <li> Controll wells and set properties by global properties - pressures and saturation in whole reservoir model.
</ol>
